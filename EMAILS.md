export async function sendEmail(template: string, to: string, data: any) {
  const templates = {
    'welcome': WelcomeEmail,

## Email Tracking & Analytics

Track these metrics:
- Open rates
- Click rates
- Bounce rates
- Unsubscribe rates

Use UTM parameters for all links:
```
?utm_source=email&utm_medium=transactional&utm_campaign=payment-failed
```

## Unsubscribe Requirements

All marketing emails must include:
